## 📖 1.0 Introduction
The Car Rental Management System is a web-based application developed to digitalize and streamline the vehicle rental process at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). The system aims to improve vehicle booking, availability tracking, and management for both customers and administrators.

## 🔍 2.0 Background Study
UTM currently lacks a centralized system to manage vehicle rentals, resulting in manual booking processes that are inefficient and error-prone. Our system will cover key areas including user registration, vehicle listing, booking, payment, and reporting.

## 🚨 3.0 Problem Statement
The absence of an integrated digital platform for car rentals has led to slow processing, booking overlaps, and difficulty in tracking vehicle usage history and availability.

## 💡 4.0 Proposed Solution
We propose a centralized Car Rental Management System to automate and manage rental services. A feasibility study shows that the solution is:
- **Technically feasible** using web technologies such as HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.
- **Operationally feasible** for both users and staff.
- **Economically feasible**, as most tools are open-source.
Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) indicates the investment in system development brings long-term operational efficiency.

## 🎯 5.0 Objectives
- To develop a user-friendly car rental platform for students and staff.
- To enable easy vehicle booking and reduce manual paperwork.
- To provide admins with tools for managing car inventory and tracking usage.

## 📌 6.0 Scope of the Project
### Included:
- User registration/login
- Car listings with availability
- Booking and confirmation
- Admin dashboard

### Not Included:
- Real-time GPS tracking
- Payment gateway integration in Phase 1
